            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="headshot.png" alt="A picture of me" class="right-image">
            <p>Hello, welcome to my personal website! I am a theoretical astrophysicist specializing in neutron stars and black holes. I am currently a third year graduate student at Stanford University, where I am advised by Roger Romani and Roger Blandford. Before arriving at Stanford, I was an undergraduate student at Columbia University, where I served as a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and studied features of merging compact binaries under the mentorship of Szabolcs and Zsuzsanna Marka.
                My research broadly focuses on relativistic outflows produced by these compact objects and the interaction with their environments, although they span all of high-energy astrophysics. The majority of my thesis work is concerned with the dynamics and electromagnetic emission from intrabinary shocks produced in spider pulsars - millisecond pulsars which ablate their close low mass companion. 
                I have also studied extragalactic radio jets, gravitational wave sources, and gamma-ray bursts. I am a member of the <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu">Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC)</a> at Stanford and the <a href="https://www.simonsceecs.com">Simons Collaboration on Extreme Electrodynamics of Compact Sources (SCEECS)</a> the Simons Collaboration on Extreme Electrodynamics of Compact Sources (SCEECS). You can learn more in the <a href="research.html">Research</a> and <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> pages of this site.

            <h2>For Fun</h2>
            <p>When not doing physics, I can most likely be found outside running since I enjoy training for and marathon races. I am an avid baseball fan and love the New York Yankees. I also speak Spanish and Portuguese and have been involved in science outreach programs that connect with the Hispanic community in the San Francisco Bay Area (which you can read more about in the <a href="outreach.html">Outreach</a> page). </p>
